title: Breast Cancer Prediction
sidebar_position: 4
slug: breast-cancer-prediction
---

In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths globally.
As of the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past 5 years,
making it the world's most prevalent cancer.

Based on current incidence rates, 12.9% of women born in the United States today will develop breast cancer at some time during their lives.

In this project we will create a ML model that will learn from [breast-cancer-wisconsin-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) to predict if a person is
diagnosed with breast cancer or not.

## 1. Collecting data

Let's import pandas first.

```python title="main.py"
import pandas as pd
```

Now, let's read our dataset.

```python title="main.py"
df = pd.read_csv('../input/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data.csv')
```

Let's check the **shape**, **head** and **tail** of our dataframe.

```python title="main.py"
df.shape
```

```python title="main.py"
df.head()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185367180-117812bf-c361-4105-9172-aa54d88d61fc.png)

```python title="main.py"
df.tail()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185367421-488a1c39-2330-470d-aced-7b9ee13f5d24.png)

## 2. Exploring Data

### 2.1. Null Values

Get a quick overview of the data. _(index, name, count, Null, Dtype)_

```python title="main.py"
df.info()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185367929-ff0af7bb-071a-4dbe-9fa9-5d58f337fbaa.png)

We can see here that most of our columns are **float64**.
Also all the have **no null values**, except for the _Unnamed_ columns that all its values are **Null**.

Let's check the second note again to make sure:

```python title="main.py"
# this one to see if there's any missing value in our columns
df.isna().any()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185368725-bb335564-5376-4be2-aaf0-b1c62e948c48.png)

```python title="main.py"
# this one to count the number of missing values in each column
df.isna().sum()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185368916-292d9dc5-da67-46b4-b4bb-9e6ed3a001d5.png)

:::note
So we made sure that _Unnamed_ column has no importance for us.
Let's drop it from our dataframe.
:::

```python title="main.py"
df.dropna(axis=1, inplace=True)
```

Let's check again.

```python title="main.py"
df.isna().sum()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185369285-c7578491-a6aa-4499-8b08-dfc37ca1a2bc.png)

### 2.2. Data Analysis

As we already said, most of our columns are **float64**. And we can see that there's only on column with type **object**.
So let's describe it.

```python title="main.py"
df.describe(include="O")
# include="O" means that we want to include object columns
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185370234-117a6a9d-0940-4937-9642-c50f91d723e9.png)

As we expected, **ONLY ONE CATEGORICAL FEATURE**. Also, it has only 2 values. _B_ and _M_ as we can expect from the head and tail.

Let's see the count of each value in **diagnosis** column.

```python title="main.py"
df['diagnosis'].value_counts()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185370848-e62eef46-bbbe-4c53-bac7-c58f90facd73.png)

Great!

:::note

- B: Benign
- M: Malignant

:::

### 2.3. Data Visualization

Now, we want check the **dependence** and **independance** of our 33 features.

Let's import matplotlib, seaborn and plotly first:

```python title="main.py"
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# configuring plt and sns
%matplotlib inline
sns.set(style="darkgrid")
```

Now, let's plot the count of values for diagnosis feature

```python title="main.py"
plt.figure(figsize=(14,8))

# ------------ with matplotlib ------------
plt.subplot(1,2,1) # 1 row, 2 columns, first plot
plt.hist(df['diagnosis']) # plot the histogram
plt.title('Counts of diagnosis')
plt.xlabel('diagnosis')

# ------------ with seaborn ------------
plt.subplot(1,2,2) # 1 row, 2 columns, second plot
sns.countplot(x='diagnosis', data=df);
plt.title('Counts of diagnosis')
# the ';' is to remove the output like <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f3a1dddba50>
# and make ploting faster
plt.show()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185377602-bdd1e909-e88e-4405-bd03-62fc89d393c0.png)

We can use **plotly** to plot the histogram.

```python title="main.py"
fig = px.histogram(df, x='diagnosis')
fig.show()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185378487-38baa2b1-a458-4448-b13c-da1fba3facbd.png)

Let's plot the **dependency** between each feature, and adding the **diagnosis** feature to the hue.

```python title="main.py"
cols = ['diagnosis',
'radius_mean',
'texture_mean',
'perimeter_mean',
'area_mean',
]
sns.pairplot(df[cols], hue="diagnosis")
plt.show()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185379313-a1cfdead-206a-414e-b32a-eab733e038d0.png)

That's it for numeric features.
Let's process our categorical feature, and convert it into numeric values using **LabelEncoder**.

### 2.4. Data Preprocessing

```python title="main.py"
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
```

LabelEncoder can be used to normalize labels.

```python title="main.py"
labelencoder_y = LabelEncoder()
# diagnosis is the target variable of our model that we are going to create
df['diagnosis'] = labelencoder_y.fit_transform(df['diagnosis'])
# fit the encoder and train it on the label, and then use it directly to convert the label into numeric values
```

Let's check what's happend to our diagnosis column.

```python title="main.py"
df['diagnosis'].value_counts()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185381298-9ae93a99-8a3e-4463-b927-d0c5ee84377a.png)

So our **B** and **M** are now **0** and **1** respectively.

Let's find the correlation between mean features.

```python title="main.py"
cols = ['diagnosis', 'radius_mean', 'texture_mean', 'perimeter_mean',
       'area_mean', 'smoothness_mean', 'compactness_mean', 'concavity_mean',
       'concave points_mean', 'symmetry_mean', 'fractal_dimension_mean']
print(f"Nbr of cols: {len(cols)}")
df[cols].corr()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185381971-284f7436-06d7-4565-9d56-825eb97bcdf3.png)

Amazing!
Now, let's plot this correlation graph.

```python title="main.py"
# using plotly
fig = px.imshow(df[cols].corr(), color_continuous_scale='RdBu')
fig.show()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185382308-cff1b968-14fb-479b-9e83-ace8ef99b913.png)

```python title="main.py"
# using seaborn
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 9))
plt.title("correlation graph")
cmap = sns.diverging_palette( 1000, 120, as_cmap=True)
sns.heatmap(df[cols].corr(), annot=True, fmt='.1%',  linewidths=.05, cmap=cmap);
plt.show()
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185382663-289fbaa5-1cae-4809-be64-f0779ab69cba.png)

So we can now choose the features to use them in our prediction model: _(features with high correlation with diagnosis)_

```python title="main.py"
prediction_features = [
    "radius_mean",
    "perimeter_mean",
    "area_mean",
    "concave points_mean",
    "concavity_mean",
    "compactness_mean",
]
target_feature = "diagnosis"
print(f"Nbr of features: {len(prediction_features)}")
```

## 3. Modeling

### 3.1. Train Test Data Sets

```python title="main.py"
X = df[prediction_features]
y = df[target_feature]
X.shape
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185384958-d6dd1594-e370-41ce-a0f0-cbf69f15aa70.png)

```python title="main.py"
y
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185385157-923c6751-d87b-4324-a364-a496a006c190.png)

So, let's split our datasets into train and test.
33% for the test with fixed random_state on 15.

```python title="main.py"
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

```python title="main.py"
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=15)
X_train.shape, X_test.shape, y_train.shape, y_test.shape
```

Amazing!
So now, we need to scale our data since we are going to create models based on Euclidean distance between the features.

```python title="main.py"
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

Let's scale our data to keep all the values in the same magnitude 0 - 1.

```python title="main.py"
sc = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc.transform(X_test)
```

:::tip
We will keep this project simple and use directly one model algorithm.

---

In the next version of the project we will try to compare between multiple algorithms so we can choose the best one with the highest accuracy.
:::

We will use **Logistic Regression** algorithm.

```python title="main.py"
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

Let's create a function to build the model.

```python title="main.py"
def build_model(model, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    score = model.score(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_pred, y_test)
    return score, accuracy, y_pred
```

Let's see the classification report of our model.

```python title="main.py"
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
```

```python title="main.py"
LR_model = LogisticRegression()
score, accuracy, y_pred = build_model(LR_model, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)
print(f"Score: {score}")
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Classification Report:\n")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185388663-19b8ab66-f191-4e3c-bb41-5fb06022e241.png)

Amazing!
Now, let's see the confusion matrix of our model.

```python title="main.py"
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
```

```python title="main.py"
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print(cm)
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185388919-18e393c0-4361-4141-8cd1-43626b2b29e7.png)

### 3.2. Model Deployment

We will be using **pickle** to save our model.

```python title="main.py"
import pickle as pkl
```

```python title="main.py"
with open("lr_model.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pkl.dump(LR_model, f)
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185389916-37a8d002-fced-49a7-b386-7ff48775365a.png)

Congratulations! You have finished the first part of this project.

Now, I'll show you how to load the model and use it in your own projects.

### 3.3. Load Model

```python title="main.py"
with open("lr_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pkl.load(f)
```

And your model will be ready to use directly.

## 4. Model Input/Output

### 4.1. Input

Is a list (1,6)

```python title="main.py"
import numpy as np

testing_list = [[-0.65601044, -0.70743449, -0.62840362, -0.94210622, -0.98649797, -1.28960781]]
np.array(testing_list).shape
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185391411-73927887-455c-460c-b502-1d29aa9a9ba0.png)

Each value in the list represents respectively:

- radius_mean
- perimeter_mean
- area_mean
- concave points_mean
- concavity_mean
- compactness_mean

:::note
the user should enter the real values, and your program should automatically scale them.

---

Save the **sc** object to transform the input into scaled data for the model.

```python title="main.py"
with open("sc.pkl", "wb") as f:
    pkl.dump(sc, f)
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/185398181-53fe0f2f-75d2-4917-8ed9-97b1065533e7.png)

And to load it:

```python title="main.py"
with open("sc.pkl", "rb") as f:
    sc = pkl.load(f)
```

:::

### 4.2. Output

The output is a list of 0 and 1.
_(0 = benign, 1 = malignant)_

```python title="main.py"
df1 = df[prediction_features]
predicted_value = LR_model.predict(sc.transform(df1.tail(1)))
predicted_value
# you can play with the tail and head to test
```
