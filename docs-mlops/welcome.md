In this lecture, we gonna discuss techniques used for **CI** _(Continuous Integration)_, **CD** _(Continuous Deployment)_, and **CT** _(Continuous Training)_ for ML systems.

## ML Ops

Applying **DevOps** principles to **ML** systems. It aims to automate the process of _integration_, _testing_, _releasing_, _deployment_ and _infrastructure management_ for ML services.

:::note the real challenge

The real challenge is not building a ML model, but **building an integrated ML system and continuously operate it in production**.

This diagram shows that ML code has no value without the rest of the system surrounding it for a real-world ML application.

:::

The other required components for a real-world ML application consists of:

- Configuration
- Automation
- Data Collection
- Data Verification
- Testing and Debugging
- Resource Management
- Model Analysis
- Process and Metadata Management
- Serving Infrastructure
- Monitoring

To build complex systems like this, we need to apply **DevOps** principles to **ML**, and that's what **ML Ops** is all about.

This tutorial will cover best practices to consider when setting up a **ML Ops** environment.
